# Symmetric Matrix Program in C

This program checks whether a square matrix is symmetric or not.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter the size of the matrix.  
2. It asks you to enter all the values of the matrix.  
3. It compares each element with its transposed position:
   - If all elements satisfy `arr[i][j] == arr[j][i]`, the matrix is symmetric.  
   - Otherwise, it is not symmetric.  
4. Finally, it prints whether the matrix is symmetric or not.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the size of the matrix.  
3. Enter all the matrix elements.  
4. See the result printed exactly as in the program.

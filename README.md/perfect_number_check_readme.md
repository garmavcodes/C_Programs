# Perfect Number Program in C

This program checks whether a number is a perfect number or not.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a number.  
2. If the number is zero, it prints `it is not a perfect number`.  
3. Otherwise, it finds all divisors of the number except itself and sums them up.  
4. Finally, it compares the sum with the original number:
   - If equal, it prints `it is a perfect number`.  
   - Otherwise, it prints `it is not a perfect number`.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the number.  
3. See whether it is a perfect number or not.

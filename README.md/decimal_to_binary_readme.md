# Decimal to Binary Program in C

This program converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a decimal number.  
2. If the number is zero, it prints `0`.  
3. Otherwise, it repeatedly divides the number by 2 and stores the remainder for each step.  
4. After finishing, it prints all the remainders in reverse order to show the binary number.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the decimal number.  
3. See the binary value printed exactly as in the program.

# Binary to Decimal Program in C

This program converts a binary number into its decimal equivalent.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a binary number.  
2. If the number is zero, it prints `0`.  
3. Otherwise, it repeatedly extracts each digit from the right, multiplies it by 2 raised to the correct power, and adds it to the total.  
4. After finishing, it prints the decimal number.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the binary number.  
3. See the decimal value printed exactly as in the program.

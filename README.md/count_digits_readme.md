# Count Digits Program in C

This program finds the number of digits in a given number.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a number.  
2. The program checks if the number is zero:
   - If yes, it counts as 1 digit.  
3. Otherwise, it repeatedly divides the number by 10 and counts each division until the number becomes zero.  
4. Finally, it prints the total number of digits.

## How to use

2. Enter the number.

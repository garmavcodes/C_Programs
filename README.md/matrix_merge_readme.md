# Matrix Merge Program in C

This program merges two matrices vertically.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter the number of rows (n) and columns (m).  
2. Then you enter the values for the first matrix.  
3. Then you enter the values for the second matrix.  
4. The program merges the second matrix below the first to form a new matrix with 2n rows.  
5. Finally, it prints the merged matrix.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the number of rows and columns.  
3. Enter the values for the first matrix.  
4. Enter the values for the second matrix.

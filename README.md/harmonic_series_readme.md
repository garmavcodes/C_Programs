This program calculates the sum of the harmonic series up to a given number.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a number `n`.  
2. It calculates the sum of the series `1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n`.  
3. Finally, it prints the sum of the series.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the number `n` till which you want the series.

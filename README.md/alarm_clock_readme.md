# Alarm Clock in C

This program acts as a simple alarm clock in the console.

## How it works

1. The user enters a time in **HH:MM:SS** format as the alarm time.  
2. The program continuously checks the current system time every second.  
3. When the current time matches the alarm time, it displays a wake-up message.  
4. The program stops automatically after the alarm triggers.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the desired alarm time in the format **HH:MM:SS**.  
3. Watch the console until the alarm time is reached.

# Factorial Program in C

This program finds the factorial of a number in two ways:  
1. Using a loop (iterative method)  
2. Using recursion (recursive function)

## How it works

1. Ask user to enter a number.  
2. If number is 0, it prints "factorial of zero is 1".  
3. Calculates factorial using a for loop.  
4. Calculates factorial using a recursive function.  
5. Prints both results.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter a number.  
3. It will show:
   - The factorial calculated by loop.  
   - The factorial calculated by recursion.

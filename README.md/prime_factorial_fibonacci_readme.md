# Prime, Factorial & Fibonacci Program in C

This program can do three things:  
1. Check if a number is prime  
2. Find factorial of a number  
3. Print Fibonacci series up to given terms

## How it works

1. First, it asks you which option you want:  
   - `1` for prime number check  
   - `2` for factorial  
   - `3` for fibonacci series

2. Then based on your choice:
   - For **prime check**:  
     - Enter a number.  
     - It tells if the number is prime or not.

   - For **factorial**:  
     - Enter a number.  
     - It shows factorial using recursion.

   - For **fibonacci series**:  
     - Enter how many terms you want.  
     - It prints the fibonacci sequence.

3. If wrong option is entered, it prints “invalid option”.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter option (1, 2, or 3).  
3. Enter number as required.  
4. See the result.

# GCD and LCM Program in C

This program calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter two numbers.  
2. It finds the GCD by checking all divisors up to the smaller of the two numbers.  
3. It finds the LCM by checking multiples starting from the larger of the two numbers until it finds a common multiple.  
4. Finally, it prints the GCD and LCM.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter two numbers.  
3. See the GCD and LCM printed exactly as in the program.

# Pascal's Triangle Program in C

This program prints Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter the number of rows required.  
2. It calculates factorials using a recursive function.  
3. Then it calculates the binomial coefficients for each row using the formula `C(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.  
4. It prints the triangle with proper alignment using spaces.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the number of rows.  
3. See Pascal's Triangle printed exactly as in the program.

# Armstrong Number Program in C

This program checks whether a number is an Armstrong number or not.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a number.  
2. If the number is zero, it prints `it is an armstrong`.  
3. Otherwise, it counts the number of digits in the number.  
4. Then it calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.  
5. Finally, it compares this sum with the original number:
   - If equal, it prints `it is armstrong`.  
   - Otherwise, it prints `it is not an armstrong`.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the number.  
3. See whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

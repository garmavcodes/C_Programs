# Number to Words Program in C

This program prints the digits of a number in words.

## How it works

1. It asks you to enter a number.  
2. If the number is `0`, it prints `zero`.  
3. Otherwise, it uses recursion to process each digit from left to right.  
4. Each digit is printed as a word (`zero`, `one`, `two`, ..., `nine`).  

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter a number.  
3. See each digit printed as a word exactly as in the program.

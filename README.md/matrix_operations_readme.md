# Matrix Operations Program in C

This program can do 4 things on matrices:  
1. Add two matrices  
2. Subtract two matrices  
3. Multiply two matrices  
4. Find transpose of a matrix  

## How it works

1. First, it asks your choice:  
   - `1` for addition  
   - `2` for subtraction  
   - `3` for multiplication  
   - `4` for transpose

2. Based on your choice:
   - **Addition / Subtraction**:
     - Enter n and m (size of matrix).
     - Enter values of matrix 1 and matrix 2.
     - It shows sum or difference of matrices.

   - **Multiplication**:
     - Enter size of first and second matrix.
     - Enter values of both matrices.
     - If sizes match (m1 == n2), it shows the product.
     - Otherwise prints "matrix unmatch".

   - **Transpose**:
     - Enter n and m (size of matrix).
     - Enter matrix values.
     - It prints the transpose of the matrix.

3. If wrong option is entered, it prints "invalid choice".

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).  
3. Enter matrix sizes and values as needed.  
4. See the result printed.

# Hangman Game in C

This is a console-based Hangman game in C.

## How it works

1. The program has a word stored internally (`puzzling`).  
2. The player guesses letters one by one.  
3. Correct guesses reveal the letters in their positions.  
4. Wrong guesses are counted as mistakes.  
5. The player wins if they guess the word before exceeding the maximum allowed mistakes.  
6. The game ends if the player guesses the word correctly or makes too many mistakes.

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. See the word represented with dashes (`-`) for each letter.  
3. Guess letters by typing one character at a time.  
4. Continue until you win or lose.

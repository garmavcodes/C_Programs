# Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play using console.

## How it works

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.  
2. Player 'x' starts first, and players take turns.  
3.  
   - Players enter their move as row and column (0 1 2).  
   - The program checks if the move is valid (inside range and not already taken).  
4. After each move:  
   - If a player wins, it prints "{player} player ,you won the game Ëš.ðŸŽ€à¼˜â‹†!!" and stops.  
   - If all spaces are filled and no one wins, it prints "ahh,its a draw!!" and stops.  
5. The board is shown after every move.  

## How to use

1. Run the program.  
2. Follow the instructions: enter row and column numbers (between 0 and 2).  
3. Play until someone wins or the board is full.

# Number Guessing Game in C

This is a simple number guessing game program.

## How it works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. It asks you to guess the number.  
3.  
   - If you guess correctly, it shows 🎀🙌🥳🏆 and changes the secret number automatically.  
   - If your guess is smaller, it says "oops,your number is small".  
   - If your guess is larger, it says "oops,your number is large".  
4. After each guess, it asks if you want to continue (y/n).  
5. You can play as many times as you want until you press something other than 'y' or 'Y'.
